# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# cat1 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat2 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat3 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat4 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat5 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat6 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat7 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat8 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat9 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
# cat10 = Cat.new(name:'', sex:'', color:'', birth_date:'', descrption:'')
